# BEM-singular-integrals

Singular integration for Laplace and Stokes kernels
for BEM using linear interpolation of function and constant interpolation
of flux using triangular or quadrilateral boundary elements

Module provides 4 subroutines calculating singular integrals for boundary element

Needed  : - coordinates of element vertices
          - source point location (vertex or center of element)

Module is free to use, provided that the following publication is cited:

J. Ravnik: Analytic expressions for singular integrals with Stokes and Laplace kernels for 
           linear triangular and quadrilateral boundary elements, 2022
